- Description: Worked on styling first. Struggled with the nav bar and carousel alignments ; solved this issue by putting classes in each div and saw what affected what. Afterwards, the interest and accomplishment pages used basic .container, .row, .col with flexbox. Also used pagination.

  - Feedback: Everything looks good I really like how there is two different ways to navigate through the pages. I also like how on each fact there is a different color. I also like how you added gifs, it makes the overall website look lively.
